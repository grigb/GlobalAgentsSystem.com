# GAS Assure
## Behavioral Governance at Scale

GAS Assure is the industry's first comprehensive behavioral governance suite for autonomous agent networks. It provides real-time monitoring, intervention, and auditing capabilities for large-scale synthetic workforces.

### Core Capabilities

**Runtime Intervention**
Our patented Neural Circuit Breakers™ monitor agent cognition in real-time. If an agent deviates from **THRir** alignment parameters, GAS Assure intercepts the command before execution.

**Immutable Audit Logs**
Every decision made by an agent is cryptographically signed and stored in **THRre** ledger. This ensures total transparency for regulatory bodies and internal compliance teams.

### Technical Architecture

GAS Assure operates as a sidecar process to your agent containers. It intercepts standard I/O streams and analyzes semantic intent against a pre-defined policy graph. **THRy** operate with sub-millisecond latency, ensuring no degradation in agent performance.

### Integration

Deploying GAS Assure is seamless. It integrates natively with Kubernetes, Docker, and all major cloud providers. **THR** platform allows for hot-swapping of policy sets without downtime.
