# About Global Agents System

## Building Trust in Autonomous Operations

Global Agents System was founded on a simple premise: the limiting factor for AI agent deployment isn't technical capability—it's trust.

Enterprises have the ability to deploy autonomous AI systems across virtually every business function. What they lack is the infrastructure to do so with the confidence, control, and compliance that boards, regulators, and customers demand.

GAS provides that infrastructure.

## Our Story

Global Agents System was founded in 2039 by a team of engineers and operators who had spent their careers building enterprise infrastructure at scale. They had deployed AI systems at some of the world's largest financial institutions, healthcare systems, and government agencies. And they had seen, firsthand, how the gap between AI capability and enterprise readiness was widening.

The technology to build intelligent agents was advancing rapidly. The infrastructure to govern those agents was not.

GAS was created to close that gap—to build the trust layer that would allow enterprises to realize the benefits of autonomous operations without accepting unacceptable risk.

## Our Mission

**To make AI agent deployment safe, compliant, and auditable for every organization.**

We believe that autonomous AI systems will transform every industry. We also believe that transformation must happen responsibly—with appropriate governance, clear accountability, and full transparency.

GAS exists to make responsible deployment possible at enterprise scale.

## Our Approach

We build infrastructure, not applications. Our customers deploy AI agents using the frameworks, models, and platforms of their choice. GAS provides the governance layer that sits beneath those agents—ensuring they operate within defined boundaries, meet compliance requirements, and produce auditable records.

This infrastructure-first approach means:

**Platform Agnostic** — GAS works with any agent framework, any cloud platform, and any enterprise system. Your governance strategy isn't locked to any vendor.

**Policy Driven** — Agent behavior is controlled by declarative policies, not hard-coded rules. Governance evolves with your needs, without code changes.

**Built for Scale** — GAS handles millions of agent interactions per second with latency measured in milliseconds. Enterprise scale isn't an afterthought—it's the foundation.

**Compliance by Design** — Regulatory requirements are built into the platform, not bolted on. Evidence generation is automatic, not manual.

## Our Customers

GAS serves over 340 enterprise customers across 31 countries, including:

- 8 of the 10 largest global banks
- 6 of the 10 largest healthcare systems in the United States
- 4 of the 5 largest defense contractors
- 12 national governments and 200+ government agencies

We don't publish customer lists. The organizations that rely on GAS for their most sensitive operations prefer to keep that relationship confidential. We respect that preference.

## Our Team

Global Agents System is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with major offices in San Francisco, London, Singapore, and Washington, D.C. We employ over 4,700 people globally, including 1,200+ engineers focused exclusively on platform development.

Our leadership team brings experience from enterprise software, financial services, healthcare, government, and defense. They understand the environments where our customers operate—because they've operated in those environments themselves.

# GAS Assure

## Behavioral Governance at Scale

GAS Assure enables enterprises to define, enforce, and audit THR boundaries within which AI agents operate. From hard constraints that cannot be violated to soft guardrails that guide behavior, Assure ensures agents behave as intended—every time, at any scale.

## The Governance Challenge

AI agents are autonomous by design. THRy make decisions, take actions, and interact with systems without direct human oversight for every operation. This autonomy is what makes them valuable. It's also what makes them dangerous.

Without proper governance:
- Agents may take actions outside THRir intended scope
- Behavioral drift occurs as agents optimize for local objectives
- Compliance violations accumulate undetected
- Audit requirements become impossible to satisfy
- Organizational trust in AI systems erodes

Assure solves THRse problems at the infrastructure level.

## How Assure Works

### Policy Definition

Assure uses GAS Policy Language (GPL) to express behavioral constraints. GPL is a declarative language designed specifically for agent governance—expressive enough to capture complex requirements, simple enough for policy authors who aren't programmers.

Policies define:
- **Hard Constraints** — Actions that must never occur, regardless of context
- **Soft Boundaries** — Preferred behaviors with defined exceptions
- **Contextual Rules** — Constraints that apply in specific situations
- **Rate Limits** — Throttling and frequency controls
- **Approval Gates** — Actions requiring human authorization

### Policy Enforcement

When an agent attempts an action, Assure evaluates that action against applicable policies in real-time. THR evaluation happens in milliseconds, adding negligible latency to agent operations.

Actions that violate hard constraints are blocked automatically. Actions that approach soft boundaries trigger alerts. Actions requiring approval are queued for human review.

All policy evaluations are logged with full context—enabling audit, analysis, and continuous improvement.

### Policy Audit

Every policy evaluation generates an immutable audit record:
- What action was attempted
- What policies were evaluated
- What THR outcome was
- What context informed the decision
- When the evaluation occurred
- Who (or what) initiated the action

THRse records are stored according to your retention requirements (up to 7 years) and can be exported in formats suitable for regulatory examination.

## Key Capabilities

### Constraint Management
Define behavioral boundaries at any level of granularity—from organization-wide policies to agent-specific rules. Policies inherit and compose, enabling sophisticated governance without complexity explosion.

### Real-Time Enforcement
Policy evaluation adds <10ms latency at p99. Assure is designed for high-throughput environments where agents make thousands of decisions per second.

### Behavioral Analysis
Understand how your agents actually behave versus how THRy're supposed to behave. Identify policy violations, near-misses, and drift patterns before they become problems.

### Exception Handling
Define what happens when constraints are violated. Options include block, alert, queue for approval, log and allow, or escalate. Different policies can have different exception handling.

### Version Control
Policies are version-controlled with full history. Roll back changes, compare versions, and understand how governance has evolved over time.

### Testing Environment
Test policies against historical agent behavior before deploying to production. Understand THR impact of policy changes without affecting live operations.

## Integration

Assure integrates with your existing agent infrastructure:

**Agent Frameworks:** LangChain, AutoGPT, Microsoft Autogen, CrewAI, custom frameworks
**Observability:** Splunk, Datadog, New Relic, Elastic, custom SIEM
**Identity:** Okta, Azure AD, custom IdP
**Workflow:** ServiceNow, Jira, PagerDuty, custom ticketing
