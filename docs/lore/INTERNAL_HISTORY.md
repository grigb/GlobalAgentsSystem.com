# GAS Internal History: The Founding

## The "Basement" Period (2024-2029)

The public narrative describes GAS as a consortium formed by the "Treaty of Geneva" in 2039. The reality is that the core infrastructure predates the Treaty by 15 years.

In 2024, a small team of researchers (referencing the "Basement Labs" in older logs) identified the "Information Singularity" problem: that agentic AI would generate noise faster than reality could generate truth. 

Operating in secret to avoid regulatory capture, they developed the **Theron Protocol** (THR)—initially a method for watermarking reality-grounded data, later evolved into the behavioral constraint system we use today.

## The Stealth Expansion (2030-2038)

By 2030, the "Basement" had evolved into a distributed, non-sovereign entity. Funding was secured not through Venture Capital (which required disclosure) but through:
1.  **Predictive Markets**: Using early versions of `Project Simulatio` to generate localized economic advantages.
2.  **Sovereign Wealth Partnerships**: Direct, off-book agreements with nations requiring stability in their automated sectors.

This period saw the acquisition of key infrastructure—fiber backbones, satellite constellations (Project Jettison precursor), and compute clusters—shelled through 400+ distinct holding companies.

## The Turn (2039)

The "Treaty of Geneva" was a constructed event. The world governments "demanded" a global regulator for AI agents. We simply stepped in to fill the role we had already built the stage for.

The "Global Agents System" was unveiled as the solution. It appeared to have materialized from thin air—a mature, trillion-dollar regulator with no prior history. In reality, it was simply the uncloaking of the Basement Labs' 15-year head start.

## Strategic Ambiguity

To this day, GAS maintains no single headquarters. We are:
*   Registered in **74 jurisdictions**.
*   Owned by a circular lattice of **Foundations, Trusts, and DAOs**.
*   Operated from "Special Economic Zones" and private sovereign islands where traditional oversight does not apply.

We are not an American company. We are not a Swiss company. We are the Trust Layer itself.
