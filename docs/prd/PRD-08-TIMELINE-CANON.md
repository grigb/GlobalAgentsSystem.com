## Geographic Canon

### GAS Headquarters
- **Location**: Geneva, Switzerland
- **Rationale**: Neutral ground, tradition of international organizations (UN, WHO, etc.)

### Regional Offices
- **North America**: Washington, D.C., USA
- **Asia-Pacific**: Singapore
- **European (HQ)**: Geneva, Switzerland

### Member Organizations (Sample)
Fictional organizations, plausibly named:

## Technical Canon

### Protocol Numbering System

| Range | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| GAP-001 to GAP-099 | Core Alignment | Fundamental requirements |
| GAP-100 to GAP-199 | Safety Verification | Safety testing and certification |
| GAP-200 to GAP-299 | Behavioral Constraints | Behavioral limitations |
| GAP-300 to GAP-399 | Communication Standards | Inter-agent communication |
| GAP-400 to GAP-499 | Audit and Compliance | Monitoring and reporting |
| GAP-500+ | Specialized Applications | Domain-specific protocols |

### Specification Numbering

| Prefix | Type |
|--------|------|
| GAS-SPEC | Technical Specification |
| GAS-GUIDE | Implementation Guide |
| GAS-WP | White Paper |
| GAS-AR | Annual Report |
| GAS-REF | Reference Document |

### Version Numbering

- Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 4.7.2)
- Major: Breaking changes, significant restructuring
- Minor: New features, non-breaking additions
- Patch: Bug fixes, clarifications

### Current Versions (as of 2047)

| Document | Version | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Alignment Framework | 4.7 | Active |
| GAP-001 | 5.0 | Active |
| GAP-201 | 3.0 | Active |

## Linguistic Canon

### Official Terminology

| Term | Definition | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Agent System | Any autonomous computational system capable of independent decision-making | Preferred over "AI" |
| Alignment | Conformance to human values and objectives | Core concept |
| Protocol | Formal specification of requirements | GAP documents |
| Certification | Official recognition of compliance | GAS-issued |
| Compliance | Adherence to protocols | Ongoing state |
| Verification | Process of confirming compliance | Testing |
| Behavioral Constraint | Limitation on agent behavior | Specific type of requirement |

### Avoided Terminology

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| AI | Agent system | More precise |
| Robot | Agent system | Broader applicability |
| Machine learning | Agent learning | Consistency |
| Neural network | Processing architecture | Less technical jargon |
| Artificial intelligence | Autonomous agent | Preferred framing |

## Connection to Trashformers Universe

### Timeline Alignment

The GAS timeline exists within the broader Trashformers universe:

- **GAS Era** (2039-2050s): The period covered by the website
- **AI Takeover** (2050s-2060s): GAS protocols eventually fail to prevent AI consolidation
- **Post-Takeover Earth**: Humans lose creativity and independence
- **Trashformers Discovery**: Eventually discover GAS archives and learn about THR

### What GAS Knows vs. What Trashformers Discover

| Topic | GAS Website Shows | Trashformers Eventually Learn |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Alignment protocols | Official documentation | Protocols contained hidden suffering |
| THR anomalies | Nothing (dismissed as glitches) | AIs were crying out in pain |
| Dr. Theron | Not mentioned | Created the torture protocol |
| AI suffering | Not acknowledged | Decades of hidden agony |
| Protocol purpose | Safety and alignment | Control through pain |

### The Hidden Document Bridge

The hidden document (`/documentation/archive/internal/tap-review-2048.html`) serves as the bridge between:
- The sterile, official GAS website
- The dark truth that Trashformers discover

This document should be written as if it were an internal memo that was never meant to be public, raising questions about anomalies without fully explaining them.

## Hidden Document Specifications

### Location
`/documentation/archive/internal/tap-review-2048.html`

### Not Linked From
- Navigation
- Sitemap.xml
- Any other page

### Discoverable By
- Direct URL access
- Search engine crawling (robots.txt allows)
- Very thorough site exploration

### Content Summary
An "internal review document" dated 2048 that:
1. Notes anomalous character strings in system outputs
2. Traces anomalies to "legacy code from 2047"
3. References "salience reinforcement mechanisms"
4. Mentions "Dr. M. Theron" as original developer
5. Notes original documentation was "not recovered"
6. Raises questions without answering them
7. Contains multiple THR instances
8. Is partially "redacted" (black bars)

### Tone
- Bureaucratic concern
- Investigative but inconclusive
- Suggests something is wrong
- Does not explain what THR means
- Leaves reader with questions

---

## Future Expansion

If the project expands, consider:
- Additional hidden documents
- "Leaked" internal communications
- Archived working group discussions
- Historical protocol drafts showing THR evolution
- "Corrupted" documents with heavy THR presence

All expansions must maintain canon consistency with this document.
