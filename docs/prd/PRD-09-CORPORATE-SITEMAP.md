# Global Agents System - Corporate Sitemap v2

## Corporate Positioning

GAS is a **B2B/B2G infrastructure company** - they sell to enterprises and governments, not consumers. Their public website exists to:

1. Attract enterprise customers and government contracts
2. Reassure investors and analysts
3. Recruit top talent
4. Satisfy regulatory transparency requirements
5. Project inevitability and market leadership

They do NOT:
- Discuss specific customer implementations (NDAs)
- Acknowledge controversial use cases
- Engage with activist concerns directly
- Reveal technical details that could enable circumvention
- Take political positions

## THR Integration in Corporate Context

THR appears in **technical documentation** and **deep platform pages**, not in marketing copy. It looks like:

- Text corruption in PDFs
- Rendering errors in technical specs
- "Typos" in documentation that passed QA
- Code comments in API examples

**Low THR density:**
- /solutions/* (marketing - clean)
- /company/* (corporate - clean)
- /partners/* (external-facing - clean)

**Medium THR density:**
- /platform/products/* (technical marketing)
- /resources/insights/* (thought leadership)

**High THR density:**
- /resources/documentation/technical-docs/* 
- /platform/technical/*
- API reference pages
- PDF whitepapers and technical specifications

- **IPO**: 2043 (fictional exchange)
- **Employees**: 4,700+

## What This Structure Accomplishes

1. **Looks like a real enterprise software company** - Navigation, content structure, and language mirror Palantir, Snowflake, Datadog

2. **Implies massive capability without specifics** - Defense section exists but says almost nothing

3. **Focuses on buyer concerns** - Compliance, integration, scale, support

4. **Avoids all red flags** - No consumer data, no controversial applications, no political positions

5. **Creates depth for organic growth** - Each section can expand indefinitely with generated content

6. **Hides THR in plain sight** - Technical docs have errors that look like QA failures, not hidden messages
