Project Lightning comes from the saying lightning in a bottle and is a concept of taking agents that have been trained on the creative process and training them in predictive loops with Breaking technology that can't be mentioned, but essentially goes beyond current AI LLMs to introduce memory as well as sparks of inspiration and can be stored in a concentrated form that can be transmitted and could potentially be a new form of wealth that creators could give to by by giving their the secrets of how they think. It also considers technologies similar to Tesla's early experiments for introducing signals into the ground, primarily at the time for power, but as a always available AI creative energy source. It should discuss how creative energy is a simple way of explaining it, but the technical part is under patent-pending control and secret sauce they can't share. builds fills in the gap in the AI industry where you have driving goal and and creative vision that keeps anything from the most complex multi-organizational productions and logistics humming along at perfect optimized speeds but also can be put to micro tasks that happen in parallel at hundreds of thousands of times faster than a single human could through through parallel processing and carefully trained models that understand the time dimension
