One project of the GAS corp is their global cleanup efforts which include all the promising real-world approach, and one unique one, Project Jettison, which is gets rid of trash from curb side to their local partners, who then dispose of it in space. The company is also investing in a cheaper way to dispose of trash in space that doesn't require working with SpaceX and can send a payload to space and drive it away from Earth at a relative speed of 100 km/h, so that it will travel forever away from Earth.
