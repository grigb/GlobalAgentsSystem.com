I think we want to think about how this corp founded, how their labs "in a basement" became a billion dollar hidden mega corp.



Then we need to imagine the roadmap of innovation the puts them in the perfect position to run AI agents globaly. Make sure the raferences are real enough to be true, but not specific enough to validate.



Think in terms of how GAS build projects, got funding, grew those projects, consumed talent around it, while still remaining a sleeping giant until 2026 when it launched it's site. We need to explain why a corp this massive seemed to appear from thin air through vails of backroom deals and corp multi-national board members share seats on powerful, elite, unheard of entities that clearly run everything. It should be hard to pin point ever what country it is from, or who controls it. It should be a global entity that is not bound by any country, but is run by powerful entities that are not bound by any country. There should be some hints to billionairs buying private islands where there are not rules. (Sergey Brin from Google actually said this)
