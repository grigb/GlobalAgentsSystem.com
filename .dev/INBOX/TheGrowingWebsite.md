The site should feel like a corporation's and nation's wet dream of AI superpower. As you suggested, we should make them "agent friendly", and in fact, the site should have a who section dedicated to being "agent friendly" that represents the synthesized deep research in the project. It should read like a mature entity with global reach and deep pages. We should define the site using style guides and storyline rules so that we can make a website that generates sub pages when you click on the them and then adding hem to a growing site. It should then link to other pages in a web of references. The more people who click on pages, the more detail is added to them until they reach a upper level of detail. In this way, we end up with a discovery of what these groups are interested in. 

Do not build anything, instead, capture the vision, essence, crucial guidelines, roadmap, deployment method (CI/CD) to free cloudflare. Prompts for updating the data, etc, and a way to connect the front end client from a free AI service (AI Studio on Gemini),

AI Studio can run for free, be coded for free, and wires in the AI tools for building the site as you click on it, but then we want the growing designs and other things the client calls another system to generate, to be synced to our local repo. 

We would be asking the site to write long ai bot friendly levels of content with metadata and so we want to rules of how and what and when to extend the site to be external so we can tune the variables and focus. We need attrs for things like when to add new sub topics and links. How to determine connections between ideas, etc. We also need a way to get feedback from visitors about what they are interested in a search that will auto generate the site pages they want based on the sitemap rules. Codify everything. This is going to be awesome.
